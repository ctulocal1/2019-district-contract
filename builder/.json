In the spirit of <cite>Plyler v. Doe,</cite> 457 U.S. 202 (1982), the Employer has consistently afforded students access to a high quality public education at Passages Charter School regardless of their immigration status and is committed to continue this practice.\n2. Passages Charter School is an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) designated “sensitive location” in which ICE enforcement activities would pose a severe disruption to the learning environment and educational setting for students and their families.\n3. AHS and the Union jointly declare that the buildings and grounds of Passages Charter School are sanctuary spaces for all students, parents, administrators, bargaining unit members, and community members and jointly commit to defend the right to a free and safe learning environment.\n4. Students and families trust AHS to maintain their safety and the integrity of their family units. To foster this continued trust, school personnel shall not inquire about or record a student’s or a family member’s immigration status and, pursuant to the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), shall not disclose, without parental consent, the immigration status of any student or other personally identifiable information. AHS recognizes the trust families place in it and shall not voluntarily divulge information to immigration agents to the fullest extent possible under the law.\n5. AHS and its staff have the right to be the first line of protection for students and families against unwarranted and detrimental immigration and enforcement actions. Upon request by ICE agents to enter Passages Charter school grounds, AHS shall verify the immigration agent’s credentials, ask the agent why the agent is requesting access, and ask to see a warrant signed by a federal or state Judge.\n6. Immigration agents seeking entry to the school or its grounds shall be asked to provide written authority from ICE instructing them to enter Passages Charter School property and for what purpose as well as a warrant signed by a federal or state Judge.\n7. In the spirit of this commitment to a sanctuary school zone, absent exigent circumstances and/or a duly signed federal or state warrant and written authority from ICE supervisors, agents of ICE shall not be permitted access school grounds or any records contained therein, nor shall the Employer otherwise release to any third parties, other than the Union, any information pertaining to immigration status except with the employee’s written consent or as required by law.\n8. In the interest of ensuring the success of the commitments made in this article, the Employer and Union shall meet to develop a training program for staff on how to appropriately respond to ICE agents should they request entrance to the school facilities or grounds as well as proactive steps to aid students and families in obtaining legal or other assistance with immigration enforcement actions.\n9. Bargaining unit employees shall not face any Employer discipline for following the policies contained in this Article.\n1. The provisions contained within this Article shall in no way prohibit the Employer from honoring and complying with a duly authorized warrant and in no way shall obligate the Employer or any of its agents to violate any State or Federal statutes.\n"},{"type":"Article","id":36,"heading":"Sanctuary Employer","content":"On September 5, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security announced the end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. The DACA policy provided work authorization documents to nearly 800,000 young people who came to the United States as children. The Employer and the Union recognize that the young people who have received DACA benefits are a valued and important part of our community. Because the termination of the DACA policy may affect the work authorization of employees of the Employer, the Employer and the Union agree to the following:\n1. The Employer reaffirms its commitment to equal opportunity in the workplace and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, age, sex, national origin, marital status, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, civil union status, domestic partnership status, parental status, immigration status, eligibility for rehire within the Chicago Public Schools, genetic information, refusal to submit to a genetic test or make available the results of a genetic test.\n2. The Employer shall not inquire about or demand proof of immigration or citizenship status, except as required by law.\n3. Upon written request, the Employer should provide for legal consultation or resources for any employee who has received a work authorization document under DACA (“affected employee”) in order to determine the extent to which said employee’s work status will be affected by the termination of DACA and whether said employee may be eligible for any employment-based immigrant or non-immigrant visas. Upon request by the Union or an affected employee, the Employer will make all reasonable efforts to sponsor an affected employee for any employment-based immigrant or non-immigrant visas for which they are eligible. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the employer from providing financial assistance to the affected employee.\n4. Upon written request, an affected employee shall be released for up to ten (10) unpaid working days in order to attend to immigration or citizenship status matters. The Employer may request verification of such absence, as long as such a request does not violate paragraphs (1) and (2).\n5. In the event that the Employer is no longer permitted to employ an affected employee, the Employer agrees to treat the affected employee’s separation as a leave of absence for purposes of the employee’s return to work. Specifically, the Employer agrees to reinstate the affected employee to the employee’s former position, if available, without loss of prior seniority upon the employee providing proper work authorization within three (3) years of the date of separation. If the former position is not available, the Employer agrees to reinstate the employee to substantially similar employment or the next available opening for which the employee is qualified and at that position’s salary with no loss of pay.\n6. Within thirty (30) days of the signing of this Agreement, the Employer and the Union shall send the following:\n    1. A joint letter to educators and support staff with resources, such as the immigrant and refugee children guide for educators and support staff.\n    2. A joint letter to students and their families with resources, such as those listed on the weareheretostay.org.\n7.
