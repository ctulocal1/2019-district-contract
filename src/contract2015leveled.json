      "content": "The purpose of this Agreement is to reaffirm the parties’ common responsibility to maintain a collaborative and collegial collective bargaining relationship that furthers the parties’ shared goal of delivering high quality instructional programs and significantly advancing a well-rounded public education for the students of the Chicago public school system.  Through free and open dialogue, the parties have identified the educational objectives for the Chicago Public Schools (hereinafter referred to as “CPS”) and have designed this Agreement to further those objectives through good faith cooperation now and in the future.The parties firmly believe that a well-rounded public education is an absolute necessity for any graduate to be considered college-, career- and citizenship-ready.  The parties also recognize that a well-rounded public education includes, but is by no means limited to, providing students with an enriched, diverse and comprehensive curriculum that allows them to obtain essential knowledge and skills; engage in critical and creative thinking; develop independent inquiry skills and an appreciation for the arts, music and literature; improve their physical and emotional health; prepare for leadership roles in their communities; attain the technical skills necessary to become career-ready; develop the academic discipline and proficiency in the intelligent use of technology necessary to become college-ready; and ultimately graduate from the Chicago public school system prepared to become productive and self-confident citizens capable of ethical participation in a free and democratic society.In addition, the parties recognize that the achievement of these educational objectives requires substantial short- and long-term financial investments in public education and that the fulfillment of the aspirations described in this Preamble will require dramatic and cooperative changes in education funding at the federal, state and local levels; a commitment to good faith collaboration; mutual agreement on priorities and values; and the adoption of proven or research-based educational methods and instructional practices.Furthermore, to foster a cosmopolitan spirit and better develop CPS students as tolerant and unbiased citizens, the BOARD and the UNION shall work affirmatively to the end that each student may have the educational advantage of an integrated school.Finally, this Agreement is intended to affirm that the parties’ shared goals will only be achieved if bargaining unit employees are fairly and adequately recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the educational process and provided with a wholesome work environment based on mutual respect and the highest level of professionalism.  The guiding principles set forth in this Preamble shall remain at the forefront of the parties’ negotiations now and in the years to come until these shared educational aspirations become a reality for each and every student and employee of the Chicago public school system."

Bargaining unit employees are entitled to a total of twelve work weeks of unpaid leave for the above-stated reasons during a “rolling” twelve-month period measured backwards from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave.  Bargaining unit employees shall be required to use their accrued sick days concurrently with any leave of absence taken under the FMLA. Employees will have the option, upon appropriate notice, to use accrued vacation days. During any leave taken under the FMLA, the employee’s health care coverage under any group health plan shall be maintained for the duration of such leave at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in employment continuously for the duration of the leave. If the employee is using vacation or sick days, the employee will accrue seniority while on FMLA leave.  Bargaining unit employees must provide at least thirty days’ advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the need for leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s son, daughter, spouse or parent. If thirty days’ notice is not practicable (such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when a leave will be required to begin, a change of circumstances or a medical emergency), notice must be given as soon as practicable. Failure to provide the notice set forth in this Section shall not affect the employee’s entitlement to the leave when the BOARD has actual knowledge of the FMLA-precipitating event.  A bargaining unit employee who takes FMLA leave shall be entitled on return from such leave to be restored to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment.  Except as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement, bargaining unit employees’ rights and obligations relating to FMLA leave shall be governed by the provisions of the FMLA (including the regulations thereunder) and BOARD rules or policies."

Teachers rated unsatisfactoryTeachers rated developing The time for appeal shall as set forth in Article 39-9A and shall commence when the teacher receives a notice of layoff/displacement.  The notice shall advise the teacher of their right to appeal their rating.A teacher receiving an unsatisfactory rating, and a second consecutive developing rating that results in an unsatisfactory rating, shall be eligible to use the appeals process by filing a notice of intent to appeal with the appeals committee within ten days of receipt of the rating and then the appeal within thirty calendar days after receipt of the rating. The teacher must also submit a copy of the appeal to the teacher’s principal or head administrator.  In the appeal, the teacher must state the factual basis for the appeal and identify the evidence that supports the appeal.   An appeal may be based on student growth ratings in whole or part only if the teacher identifies a data integrity or data analysis error.Upon receiving an appeal, the appeals committee shall review the written record of the rating. The “written record of the rating” includes (1) the documents and materials submitted by the teacher to the evaluators during pre-conferences and post-conferences or at other times as evidence of the teacher’s practice and (2) the evaluator’s observations, comments and feedback.  The written record of the rating shall not include materials and evidence that the teacher or evaluator was not privy to during the rating process.If the committee determines the written record of the rating to be insufficient to make a ruling, it shall schedule a meeting with the teacher at which the teacher shall be represented by the UNION and with at least one of the qualified evaluator-observers who contributed observation ratings to the teacher’s rating.  The meeting shall take place within ten school days of receipt of the appeal.The BOARD shall provide the teacher and the UNION with all evidence used by the qualified evaluator to determine the summative rating under appeal five days prior to the meeting.After reviewing the written record of the rating, the appeals committee shall have the right to meet with the teacher and to determine if a formal observation of the teacher appealing the rating shall take place to assist it in its determination.  If an observation does take place, the two jointly appointed appeals committee members must conduct the pre-observation conference in accordance with Article 39-2.3(C)(2), and the observation shall take place within five school days of the pre-observation conference.After a review of the written record of the rating and any interview with the teacher and evaluator, and any observation, and following deliberation, the appeals committee may overturn the rating if three of its members conclude that the rating under review is erroneous.  If the appeals committee determines by majority vote that the teacher’s appeal is to be granted, the BOARD shall revoke the summative rating under appeal and issue the teacher an appropriate summative evaluation.  A different qualified evaluator shall be assigned to the teacher during the next school year who shall follow all applicable provisions of this Article.  No developing rating that results from a sustained appeal of an unsatisfactory rating shall count towards the two-developing rule.An appeal shall not delay the commencement of a professional development plan or remediation plan."

Prequalified teachers shall include: (a) tenured teachers laid off for any reason on or after June 15, 2010 whose most recent performance rating was in the top two rating categories (i.e., excellent or superior and excellent or proficient); and (b) new applicants and other teachers who pass uniform pre-screening hiring criteria, including the consideration of employment history.Tenured Teachers laid off between June 15, 2010 and June 30, 2012 will not be placed on the teacher eligibility list if they are currently employed by the BOARD in a full-time teacher position or have previously resigned or retired.Eligible tenured teachers will be invited to be on the teacher eligibility list and to confirm their desire to be on the list (such as completing an on-line application). The UNION will be copied on all communications.Prequalified teachers will be admitted to the eligibility list as they are laid off and shall remain on the teacher eligibility list for two years or until they receive a permanent appointment, whichever first occurs. However, teachers placed on the eligibility list during 2012 will remain on the list until June 30, 2015.Inter-unit transfers are exempt from the process described in this Section.Principals shall hire only prequalified applicants to permanent teaching positions and shall have the discretion to hire any prequalified teacher. However, principals who receive three or more applications from prequalified displaced tenured teachers for a posted vacancy must interview at least three prequalified displaced tenured teachers for the position. If the principal does not select a prequalified displaced tenured teacher, the principal shall provide the reason(s) for the non-selection to the Talent Office, which shall communicate the reason(s) to the prequalified displaced tenured teacher. Such reasons may not be arbitrary.Every July 1, the BOARD shall provide the UNION with a list of permanent vacancies filled by teachers on the eligibility list between the immediately preceding July 1 to June 30 period. If fifty percent of those vacancies have not been filled by prequalified displaced tenured teachers, the BOARD will assign a number of prequalified displaced tenured teachers who were on the eligibility list on the immediately preceding June 30 to the reassigned teacher pool for a period of five school months, but excluding:displaced teachers then currently in the reassigned teacher pool under another provision of this Agreement; andtenured teachers displaced between June 15, 2010 and June 30, 2012 who were placed into the Reassigned Teacher Pool upon layoff.Assignments to the reassigned teacher pool shall be based on seniority. The number of prequalified displaced tenured teachers assigned shall equal the difference between the numerical value of fifty percent of the permanent vacancies filled during the immediately preceding July 1 to June 30 period and the actual number of vacancies filled by prequalified displaced tenured teachers. Prequalified displaced tenured teachers who are placed in the reassigned teacher pool and who do not find a permanent appointment by the end of their five-month assignment shall be assigned to the Cadre for five school months. If the prequalified displaced tenured teacher is not appointed to a position by the end of his or her assignment in the Cadre, he or she shall be laid off and separated from BOARD employment, but will remain on the teacher eligibility list for the remainder of his or her two years of eligibility.\n                Tenured Teachers Laid Off Due to School Actions.Tenured teachers laid off due to school actions shall receive the following benefits:\n                  Transfer to receiving schools in school closings and consolidations. Tenured teachers whose most recent rating is in the top two rating categories (i.e., excellent or superior and excellent or proficient) shall be appointed to a vacancy at a school to which students from their school have been assigned to the extent that a vacancy within the teacher’s certification has been created as a result of or in connection with the transfer of students. If more than one teacher is eligible for appointment to the same vacancy, selection for the vacancy shall be based on seniority.\n                  Alternative severance benefit. A tenured teacher who has been laid off due to school actions shall be offered the opportunity to resign and receive three months of pay.\n                Tenured Teachers Laid Off for Reasons Other Than Economic Actions and School Actions.\n                Recall to unit.A tenured teacher who has been laid off from a school or unit shall be entitled to recall to the same school or unit from which he or she had been laid off for a period of ten school months from the date of layoff, provided that a vacancy within his or her certification is created at the school or unit and that the teacher has been rated proficient or better. Tenured teachers shall be recalled in inverse order of layoff."
