  heading: Preamble
  content: |
    The purpose of this Agreement is to reaffirm the parties’ common responsibility to maintain a collaborative and collegial collective bargaining relationship that furthers the parties’ shared goal of delivering high quality instructional programs and significantly advancing a well-rounded public education for the students of the Chicago public school system.  Through free and open dialogue, the parties have identified the educational objectives for the Chicago Public Schools (hereinafter referred to as “CPS”) and have designed this Agreement to further those objectives through good faith cooperation now and in the future.

    The parties firmly believe that a well-rounded public education is an absolute necessity for any graduate to be considered college-, career- and citizenship-ready.  The parties also recognize that a well-rounded public education includes, but is by no means limited to, providing students with an enriched, diverse and comprehensive curriculum that allows them to obtain essential knowledge and skills; engage in critical and creative thinking; develop independent inquiry skills and an appreciation for the arts, music and literature; improve their physical and emotional health; prepare for leadership roles in their communities; attain the technical skills necessary to become career-ready; develop the academic discipline and proficiency in the intelligent use of technology necessary to become college-ready; and ultimately graduate from the Chicago public school system prepared to become productive and self-confident citizens capable of ethical participation in a free and democratic society.

    In addition, the parties recognize that the achievement of these educational objectives requires substantial short- and long-term financial investments in public education and that the fulfillment of the aspirations described in this Preamble will require dramatic and cooperative changes in education funding at the federal, state and local levels; a commitment to good faith collaboration; mutual agreement on priorities and values; and the adoption of proven or research-based educational methods and instructional practices.

    Furthermore, to foster a cosmopolitan spirit and better develop CPS students as tolerant and unbiased citizens, the BOARD and the UNION shall work affirmatively to the end that each student may have the educational advantage of an integrated school.

    Finally, this Agreement is intended to affirm that the parties’ shared goals will only be achieved if bargaining unit employees are fairly and adequately recognized and rewarded for their contributions to the educational process and provided with a wholesome work environment based on mutual respect and the highest level of professionalism.  The guiding principles set forth in this Preamble shall remain at the forefront of the parties’ negotiations now and in the years to come until these shared educational aspirations become a reality for each and every student and employee of the Chicago public school system.

  heading: Appeals Process
  content: |


    A teacher appeals process shall be established to contest certain summative ratings given by a qualified evaluator. It shall be comprised of a committee of four active or retired educators, two of whom shall be selected by agreement of the UNION President and Chief Executive Officer, one of whom shall be selected by the UNION and one of whom shall be selected by the BOARD. All members of the committee shall be qualified evaluators. Both the BOARD and the UNION shall select qualified alternate committee members who may substitute for their regularly appointed members. Individual members of the committee must recuse themselves from cases where they have personal familiarity with the teacher appealing a summative rating and will be replaced by the same appointing entity. The Joint Committee shall determine whether the appeals process exists after school year 2018-2019.

    The following teachers will have a right to appeal their ratings according to the timelines outlined in Article 39-9.A:

    ● 	Teachers rated unsatisfactory

    ● 	Tenured teachers receiving ratings in the lower half of developing

    The following teachers will have right to appeal their ratings if they are laid off out of order of seniority.

    ● 	Teachers rated unsatisfactory

    ● 	Teachers rated developing

    The time for appeal shall as set forth in Article 39-9A and shall commence when the teacher receives a notice of layoff/displacement. The notice shall advise the teacher of their right to appeal their rating.

    A.	A teacher receiving an unsatisfactory rating, and a second consecutive developing rating that results in an unsatisfactory rating, shall be eligible to use the appeals process by filing a notice of intent to appeal with the appeals committee within ten days of receipt of the rating and then the appeal within thirty calendar days after receipt of the rating. The teacher must also submit a copy of the appeal to the teacher’s principal or head administrator.  In the appeal, the teacher must state the factual basis for the appeal and identify the evidence that supports the appeal.   An appeal may be based on student growth ratings in whole or part only if the teacher identifies a data integrity or data analysis error.

    B.	Upon receiving an appeal, the appeals committee shall review the written record of the rating. The “written record of the rating” includes (1) the documents and materials submitted by the teacher to the evaluators during pre-conferences and post-conferences or at other times as evidence of the teacher’s practice and (2) the evaluator’s observations, comments and feedback.  The written record of the rating shall not include materials and evidence that the teacher or evaluator was not privy to during the rating process.

    C.	If the committee determines the written record of the rating to be insufficient to make a ruling, it shall schedule a meeting with the teacher at which the teacher shall be represented by the UNION and with at least one of the qualified evaluator-observers who contributed observation ratings to the teacher’s rating.  The meeting shall take place within ten school days of receipt of the appeal.

    D.	The BOARD shall provide the teacher and the UNION with all evidence used by the qualified evaluator to determine the summative rating under appeal five days prior to the meeting.

    E.	After reviewing the written record of the rating, the appeals committee shall have the right to meet with the teacher and to determine if a formal observation of the teacher appealing the rating shall take place to assist it in its determination.  If an observation does take place, the two jointly appointed appeals committee members must conduct the pre-observation conference in accordance with Article 39-2.3(C)(2), and the observation shall take place within five school days of the pre-observation conference.

    F. 	After a review of the written record of the rating and any interview with the teacher and evaluator, and any observation, and following deliberation, the appeals committee may overturn the rating if three of its members conclude that the rating under review is erroneous. If the appeals committee determines by majority vote that the teacher’s appeal is to be granted, the BOARD shall revoke the summative rating under appeal and issue the teacher a 250 if an unsatisfactory rating was revoked, a 284 if an emerging rating (210-250) was revoked, or a 285 if a developing rating (251-284) was revoked an appropriate summative evaluation. A different qualified evaluator shall be assigned to the teacher during the next school year who shall follow all applicable provisions of this Article. No developing rating that results from a sustained appeal of an unsatisfactory rating shall count towards the two- developing rule.

    APPENDIX F

    [RESERVED]

    (formerly GUIDELINES FOR TRANSFER OF SICK DAYS -- See Article 37)

    APPENDIX G

    FMLA LEAVE

    Bargaining unit employees regularly employed on a year-round basis who have been employed for at least twelve months and who have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours of service during the previous twelve-month period and bargaining unit employees regularly employed on a ten-month basis who have been employed for the equivalent of at least twelve months and who have worked the equivalent of a minimum of 1,250 hours of service during the previous twelve-month period shall be entitled to unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) for any of the following reasons:

    (a)	To provide care for a son or daughter during the twelve-month period after the birth of such child;

    (b)	To provide care for a son or daughter during the twelve-month period after such child is adopted by or placed in the foster care of the employee;

    (c)	To provide care for a son, daughter, spouse or parent with a serious health condition; or

    (d)	To treat or recover from a serious health condition of the employee.

    Bargaining unit employees are entitled to a total of twelve work weeks of unpaid leave for the above-stated reasons during a “rolling” twelve-month period measured backwards from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave.

    Bargaining unit employees shall be required to use their accrued sick days concurrently with any leave of absence taken under the FMLA.  Employees will have the option, upon appropriate notice, to use accrued vacation days.  During any leave taken under the FMLA, the employee’s health care coverage under any group health plan shall be maintained for the duration of such leave at the level and under the conditions coverage would have been provided if the employee had continued in employment continuously for the duration of the leave.  If the employee is using vacation or sick days, the employee will accrue seniority while on FMLA leave.

    Bargaining unit employees must provide at least thirty days’ advance notice before FMLA leave is to begin if the need for leave is foreseeable based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster care or planned medical treatment for a serious health condition of the employee or the employee’s son, daughter, spouse or parent.  If thirty days’ notice is not practicable (such as because of a lack of knowledge of approximately when a leave will be required to begin, a change of circumstances or a medical emergency), notice must be given as soon as practicable.  Failure to provide the notice set forth in this Section shall not affect the employee’s entitlement to the leave when the BOARD has actual knowledge of the FMLA-precipitating event.

    A bargaining unit employee who takes FMLA leave shall be entitled on return from such leave to be restored to the position of employment held by the employee when the leave commenced or to an equivalent position with equivalent employment benefits, pay and other terms and conditions of employment.

    Except as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement, bargaining unit employees’ rights and obligations relating to FMLA leave shall be governed by the provisions of the FMLA (including the regulations thereunder) and BOARD rules or policies.

  content: |


    Section 1 – Definitions

    A.	School actions.  BOARD-approved actions to close, consolidate, phase-out or turnaround a school.

    B.	School closing.  A student attendance center is closed, its attendance area boundary redistributed to two or more schools and its students reassigned to one or more schools.

    C.	School consolidation.  A student attendance center is closed, its attendance area boundary merged with one other school and its students reassigned to one other school.

    D.	Phase-out.  A student attendance center is gradually closed through the reassignment of the area attendance boundary to one or more other student attendance centers with no students reassigned; such center may later be closed or consolidated.

    E.  	Turnaround or reconstitution.  All employees of the school are removed from the school and reassigned or laid off with no students reassigned to other schools.

    F.	Economic actions.  Economic actions are those for which the cause of the layoff of the employee is the BOARD’s, unit’s or school’s lack of funds to maintain current staffing levels; economic actions may take the form of different transactions, including, but not limited to, class size increases, changes in position definitions (i.e., redefinitions) to meet program needs, elimination of positions or the reduction of positions from full- to part-time.

    G.	Other actions.  Actions that are not school actions or economic actions.  They may be based on a school’s enrollment or a school’s or unit’s educational program and may include, but not be limited to, (i) drops in enrollment whereby a student attendance center receives fewer positions or less resources due to a decline in student enrollment, (ii) changes in the educational or academic focus of the attendance center whereby an entire attendance center or a substantial part of an attendance center becomes focused on or changes its focus to a particular content area or form of pedagogy (e.g., International Baccalaureate, Montessori or STEM) that necessitates specialized credentials for or training of teaching staff and sometimes support staff, (iii) program closures whereby special programs are eliminated (e.g., a grant-funded reading program ends), (iv) redefinitions, (v) elimination of positions or (vi) reduction of positions from full- to part-time.

    Section 2 – Scope of Policy

    Whenever there is a reduction in or change in the teaching force that results in the lay off of appointed teachers, teachers will be reassigned or laid off in accordance with this policy.

    Section 3 – Order of Teacher Layoff

    If changes in an attendance center or program require the lay off of some but not all teachers, the order of layoff of teachers within the affected unit and certification shall be by the following performance tiers and/or as follows:

    When a determination is made that a teacher’s services are no longer required at an attendance center, the teacher will be so notified (hereinafter “notice of layoff”) twenty-one days in advance of the effective date of layoff, except in the case of 20th day position closing.

    Section 5 –Tenured Teachers’ Benefits Upon Layoff

    A. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, all tenured teachers, except those whose last summative rating was unsatisfactory, upon layoff for any reason on or after June 21, 2016 shall be placed in the Reassigned Teacher Pool at the start of the subsequent school year (or, in the case of teachers laid off during the school year, immediately after the effective date of layoff) for 10 school months.  Those tenured teachers shall be placed in a full-time teacher vacancy that exists on the 20th day of the school year and for which they are qualified for the balance of the school year on a temporary basis without loss of salary or benefits.  If that vacancy is filled by someone other than the tenured teacher before the expiration of 10 school months, the tenured teacher shall be returned to the reassigned teacher pool for the remainder of 10 school months.  If no vacancy exists for which a teacher is qualified on the 20th day, the teacher shall remain in the Reassigned Teacher Pool for 10 school months.

    After ratification of this Agreement, tenured teachers eligible for this benefit who were laid off at the end of the 2015-2016 school year shall be placed in the Reassigned Teacher Pool effective the second semester of the 2016-2017 school year for 10 school months.

    APPENDIX I

    LAYOFF, INTERIM ASSIGNMENT AND REAPPOINTMENT OF PSRPS

    The BOARD’s Layoff, Interim Assignment and Reappointment of Educational Support Personnel (“ESP”) Policy incorporated herein and reads in pertinent part as follows:

    I.	LAYOFF, RE-STAFFING, AND REAPPOINTMENT OF BARGAINING UNIT ESP.  The provisions of Section I of this policy govern the CEO’s or designee’s decisions to layoff BOARD employees in educational support personnel classifications or job titles in bargaining units certified for the purposes of collective bargaining (“bargaining unit ESP employees” or “bargaining unit PSRP employees”).

    A.  	Reasons for Reductions in Force of Bargaining Unit ESP Employees:  The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or designee may conduct reductions in force, layoff or dismiss bargaining unit ESP employees for the following reasons:

    (1)	lack of work or funds,

    (2)	decline in student enrollment,

    (3)	change in subject requirements,

    (4)	closing of an attendance center, department or unit,

    (5)	privatization contracts with third parties,

    (6)	abolition of positions because of changes in duties associated with them,

    (7)	change in organizational structure,

    (8)	reconstitution of attendance centers pursuant to Section 34-8.3 of the Illinois School Code,

    (9)	intervention in an attendance center under Section 34-8.4 of the Illinois School Code, or

    (10)	any other reason, which in the exercise of the CEO or designee’s discretion, make a reduction in force necessary or prudent.

    B.  	Notice of Layoff.  When the CEO or designee decides to conduct a reduction in the work force which results in the layoff of bargaining unit ESP employees, the CEO or designee will give fourteen (14) calendar days’ advance written notice to affected bargaining unit ESP employees or, if notice is given during the bargaining unit ESP employees’ regular work year, fourteen (14) calendar days pay in lieu of advance notice.  The CEO or designee will enclose with the notice of layoff:  1) a list of ESP vacancies then existing; 2) instructions about how to learn about future ESP vacancies; 3) instructions on how to apply for bargaining unit vacancies posted on the Human Resources Department’s on-line job bulletin in accordance with Section I.E.1 of this policy; and 4) instructions on how to change address and contact information with the Talent Office.

    C. 	Criteria for Determining Bargaining Unit ESP Employees to Be Laid Off.

    The school principal or unit head shall determine the number of positions and which classification(s) within the unit shall be affected.  Employees within those classifications will be laid off in the following order:

    1.      Employees who do not possess the highly qualified status or who do not hold necessary certifications or other qualifications;

  id: 4.
  heading: All other employees by seniority
  content: |


    For the purposes of this policy only, “seniority” with regard to layoff and reappointment shall mean the length of full-time accumulated service in any career service/ESP position, with such seniority accruing from the date of initial appointment to a career service/ESP position with the BOARD.  This definition of “seniority” shall apply only to those ESP employees who are represented by a bargaining unit at the time of their layoff.

    D.  	Re-staffing of a Bargaining Unit ESP Position in the Laid Off ESP Employee’s Classification or Job Title at the School or Unit During the 2 Years following Layoff of Bargaining Unit ESP Employees.  This recall provision shall apply to PSRPs laid off on or after February 1, 2014.  Except as provided in Section I.F of this policy (concerning layoffs under the BOARD’s Closing of Schools Policy or Sections 34-8.3 or 34-8.4 of the Illinois School Code), and excluding employees whose last rating was unsatisfactory, if a school or unit opens a bargaining unit position in the same job title from which one or more ESP employees at that school or unit was laid off within two (2) years of the effective date of the affected laid off bargaining unit ESP employee(s)’ layoff(s), the CEO or designee shall offer to re-staff laid off bargaining unit ESP employees to the position in order of seniority, provided that the laid off bargaining unit ESP employee meets all of the qualifications for the position, including, where applicable, being highly qualified for the position in accordance with applicable BOARD policies and state and federal rules and regulations. The CEO or designee shall make the offer to re-staff to an eligible laid off bargaining unit ESP irrespective of whether or not a laid off bargaining unit ESP has accepted an interim assignment under the provisions of Section I.E of this Policy or a permanent appointment in another position or at another school.  A laid off bargaining unit ESP employee offered re-staffing under this provision must demonstrate highly qualified status for the position to the Talent Office in accordance with existing staffing procedures.  Failure to do so will result in revocation of the offer to re-staff.

    In the case of a school closing or consolidation, teacher assistants rated proficient or better who are assigned to provide services to a student under an IEP who is transferred shall be transferred with the student to the receiving school or other school that the student chooses.

    F.	Eligibility Pool for Consideration for and Interim Assignment to Certain Bargaining Unit Positions.  The CEO or designee shall maintain a list of laid off bargaining unit ESP employees by job title who are seeking re-employment with the BOARD for a period of ten (10) school months after the effective date of their layoff.  The list will constitute the eligibility pool.  Laid off bargaining unit ESP employees in the eligibility pool will be eligible for interviews for appointment to BOARD-funded positions for which they apply in accordance with this Policy and for an interim assignment to a vacant position in the title from which they were laid off and for which they meet the minimum qualifications as follows:

    (1) 	Eligibility for Interviews for Bargaining Unit ESP Vacancies Posted on the Human Resources Department’s On-line Job Bulletin.  A laid off bargaining unit ESP employee in the eligibility pool may apply for BOARD-funded bargaining unit vacancies in his or her former job title at schools or units other than that from which he/she was laid off that are posted on the Human Resources Department’s on-line job bulletin for which they qualify by submitting a timely application to the Talent Office in accordance with instructions in their notice of layoff and in accordance with the posting.  If a laid off bargaining unit ESP employee applies for a BOARD-funded vacant bargaining unit ESP position and meets the minimum qualifications for the position as advertised including being highly qualified in accordance with BOARD Policy and state and federal regulations, the principal or unit head shall interview and give the laid off bargaining unit ESP consideration for appointment to the position on the same terms as other qualified applicants.
